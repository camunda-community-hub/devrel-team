# Who Are We?

We're a globally distributed team made up of developers and tech-savvy individuals who care about the tech community. We enjoy creating diverse and inclusive communities that provide solutions for our technical audiences. We have two distinct teams:
* **Developer Relations** focuses on creating a valuable community experience for Camunda users and encouraging external advocates to spread the word about Camunda. We do this by ensuring people can find solutions to their problems through the forum & content, listening to the feedback from our community and passing it along to the proper teams, and making it easy for community members to contribute code as well as content.
* **Developer Experience** focuses on external developer enablement for products through documentation and product-adjacent tools at Camunda. Our mission is to lower barriers for all developers working programmatically in and around the Camunda ecosystem to get what they need to be effective with Camunda efficiently.
